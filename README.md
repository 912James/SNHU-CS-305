CS-305 Software Security

1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

Our client, Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artemis Financial wants to modernize their operations. As a crucial part of the success of their custom software, they also want to use the most current and effective software security. Artemis Financial has a RESTful web API. They are seeking our company, Global Rain’s expertise about how to protect the organization from external threats.



2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

Manually inspecting the code I came across multiple vulnerabilities within the different different Java files. The code as presented left Artemis at risk to multiple forms of attack. Artemis also did not use HTTPS to share sentive information, thus putting their company but more importantly the customers data at risk. Looking through the vulnerabilities assessment, showed that most of Artemis's system was outdated, in need of updating the software to ensure that every vulnerability was patched. Coding securely is crucial for several reasons, as it helps protect applications, systems, and the data they handle from various security threats. Software security adds significant value to a company's overall wellbeing in several ways. Investing in robust software security measures, as Artemis has done, not only protects the company's sensitive information and infrastructure but also provides numerous indirect benefits that contribute to its overall health and success.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

I did not find the vulnerability assessment challenging due to the resources we had available. We were introduced to the NATIONAL VULNERABILITY DATABASE and CVE search where every vulnerability was addressed, with details of how the vulnerability affected consumers, but also how to fix or patch the vulnerability.

4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment
